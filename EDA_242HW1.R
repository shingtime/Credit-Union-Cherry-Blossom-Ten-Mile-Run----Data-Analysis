####### Plot the distributions of age  ###############

## overall distribution

## overall distribution: right skewed.
## distribution of age by sex (histrogram)
ggplot(data=data,aes(x=ag,fill=sex))+geom_histogram(binwidth=0.7,alpha=0.5,position="identity")+ggtitle("Age distribution by sex")
#### male runners age distributions are right skewed.
## distribution  of age by year (histogram)
ggplot(data, aes(x=ag)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.6, colour="blue", fill="white") + facet_grid(.~ year,scales="free", space="free")
#### each year's distributions are quite similiar. But there are more runners in the recent years.
## distribution in each year for male and female
ggplot(data, aes(x=ag)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=.6, colour="black", fill="white") + facet_grid(sex~year,scales="free", space="free")
## It seems that runners are younger in each year for female. Because ##the peak is left skewed. The distributions are all slightly right-skewed.

## median gun_times along with year don't change a lot for both male and female runners.
### Male runners spend less time to finish the game. The average gun_time increases in each year.
